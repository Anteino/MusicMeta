# MusicMeta

When you're collecting music from different sources like SoundCloud, Beatport, DJ Pools, etc, it can be a pain to manually set all the track info.

Use this repository to collect and assign meta data of your audio files in bulk. The program takes the filename of your tracks and uses the beatport API (https://www.beatport.com/api/v4/catalog/search) to find the most accurate match.
